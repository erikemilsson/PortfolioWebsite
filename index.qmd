## Optimizing European Battery Recycling Through a Data-Driven Location and Technology Analysis

[Github Repo](https://github.com/erikemilsson/ELiMINATE_EU_MFA), [EU-funded Project Report](https://ivl.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1822105/FULLTEXT01.pdf), and [Project Page](https://www.era-learn.eu/network-information/networks/era-min-2/era-min-joint-call-2019/end-of-life-li-ion-battery-management-integration-and-technology-evaluation)

**Technologies used:** Python (Pandas, Plotly, PuLP) & Power BI.

**Business Problem:** The European Union aims to scale battery recycling to meet growing demand from the electric vehicle market while reducing carbon emissions. The challenge is determining optimal locations and selecting the right recycling technologies to close Europe's recycling capacity gap of 98,667 annual tonnes of battery cells scrap expected from 2026 onward.

**Solution:** I developed an optimization model using geographic data and material flows to determine the best locations for recycling facilities. This model incorporates facility costs, CO2 emissions, and transportation costs, providing a roadmap for efficient and sustainable battery recycling in Europe.

### Method and Data

*Summary: This project involved scraping and processing market data to optimize facility locations and technologies. Tools like Python and Power BI were used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.*

Used bottom-up data scraping with open-data on battery bill-of-materials to linearly extrapolate and estimate battery volumes and geographical coordinates for each battery actor, addressing the lack of comprehensive market data. 

Collaborated with cost analyst and LCA expert to integrate technoeconomic assessment and CO2-emissions on a country-basis. 

Processed data and created an optimization model in Python with Pandas and PuLP packages. Created dynamic GIS and Sankey visualization using Python's Plotly package. Created dynamic Power BI dashboard with Power BI.

### Results

*Key Findings:*

- *Recommended a single H2SO4 facility in Germany as the most cost-effective solution based on current market projections and transportation cost estimates.*
- *Competitive landscape: High recycler concentration in Central Europe and a second cluster with fewer recyclers in Northern Europe.*
- *Dashboard enhances decision-making by identifying competitors and capacity projections.*

Potential supply (collection points) and demand (battery producer locations) were mapped with their maximum processing volumes. The data on how other networks of recyclers in the region are unknown and thus the optimization would be incomplete without additional insights. The choice was made to scale the facility's processing volumes to Europe's projected unrecycled battery scrap in 2026 and find the optimal facility location disregarding the other networks. The optimization results in conjunction with a dashboard showing the projected processing volumes of other recyclers (competitors) over time gave an overal picture of suitable facility locations.

Below are projected market for supply- and demand-nodes for lithium-ion battery recyclers in Europe for 2030. The optimal cost and CO2-emissions were then calculated for combinations of supply- and demand-points. Different countries have different costs and CO2-emissions. The transportation costs were varied from between a low and high estimate based on usual costs and cost estimates for hazardous waste, as it was still not decided by the EU how battery waste would be classified. This tradeoff was done to focus on monetary costs.

Next are the optimal networks based on cost for the two transport cost estimates. For all technologies, regardless of transport estimate, the optimal number of facilities was one. The H2SO4 technology had the absolute lowest cost, with a network concentrated in Germany. A lower transport cost moved the optimzal network for MSA and H2SO4-NMC technologies to Northern Europe.

The Power BI dashboard gives users the an additional perspective to the best location for the facility, by breaking down competitors by volumes processed for the years 2022, 2026, and 2030. Central Europe has a high concentration of recyclers opening up, meaning competition in the area will be fierce. Clicking the circles gives the company name and volumes processed, providing valuable information to determine who will likely be the biggest competitors for adding a new facility to the European region.
