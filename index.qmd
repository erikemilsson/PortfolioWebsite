From my experience I am convinced that understanding and mastering **data tools** and **cloud services** is the way forward for effective engineering and making accessible technologies for businesses and individuals that can improve *efficiency*, *safety*, and *quality of life*.

## Competency Overview

I have over six year's experience in **sustainability management consulting** in the product development & purchasing departments of a multi-national manufacturing conglomerate. In parallel, I have **data analytics/science** experience from several EU-funded research projects within electrification and circular economy. From my formal education in B.Sc **chemical engineering** (with engineering physics), and a M.Sc. **applied physics** I have a solid understanding of **applied mathematical modelling** and **statistics**.

I'm a certified [**Power BI data analyst**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/ErikEmilsson-8069/5E435A2FA1F8B691?sharingId=BB4E4B973D67B45F) associate and I'm also certified in [**Azure cloud**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/ErikEmilsson-8069/B0D068A103061930?sharingId=BB4E4B973D67B45F) and [**Azure AI**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/ErikEmilsson-8069/6F71EC0D6B0C4683?sharingId=BB4E4B973D67B45F) fundamentals. I'm also well underway to become certified in end-to-end enterprise analytics as a **Fabric Analytics Engineer** associate.
